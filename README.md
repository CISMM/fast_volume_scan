# fast_volume_scan

The repository hosts the collection of LabView programs that image cells in 2D, 3D, and multiple channels.

3D volumetric scans require input of a text file of timings, lightsheet positions, and focoal distance for each step, which can be created by [this program](https://github.com/CISMM/lightsheet-volume-scan).
